st.markdown("""
The Building Feature Characterization Tool is a state-of-the-art application designed to provide insights 
into a building's energy use behavior using heating and cooling load signatures. 
This tool leverages the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict energy-related building features, 
offering a scalable and efficient approach for identifying retrofit opportunities.

# Methodology Section
st.header('Methodology:')


st.markdown("""
1. **Base Model Generation:**
   - Different mid-rise office archetypes are created to represent various mid-rise office building types, considering 
   window-to-wall ratios (WWRs) and aspect ratios.
   
2. **Base Model Variants:**
   - The energy-related features (envelope, internal gains, and HVAC operation) are randomly sampled into feature sets, 
   and simulations are performed using EnergyPlus to extract heating and cooling load signatures.
2. **Three-Parameter Change Point Models (3P CPMs):**
   - Heating and cooling load signatures are characterized by 3P CPMs, serving as indicators of energy use behavior.
3. **ANN-Based Surrogate Modeling:**
   - A specialized ANN model is trained to map 3P CPMs to plausible energy-related feature sets.
   - The ANN model consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers, fine-tuned to achieve 
   optimal performance.
4. **Validation and Testing:**
   - The model is validated against real-world case studies, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

# Inputs Section
st.header('Inputs:')
st.markdown("""
- **Archetype Configuration:** Information related to the building's aspect ratio and WWR configuration can further 
refine the predictions.
- **Heating and Cooling Load Signatures:** These are the primary inputs required to characterize the building's energy 
performance.
""")

# Outputs Section
st.header('Outputs:')
st.markdown("""
- **Probable Energy-Related Building Features:** The tool predicts a range of plausible feature sets: 
    - Thermal transittance: window U-values, SHGC, wall R-values 
    - Air exchange: infiltration rate and ventilation rate
    - Casual gains: lighting and plug load density (LPD) and the fraction of afterhour LPD use
    - A range of HVAC operation and control and features
- **Recommendations for Retrofit Opportunities:** Based on the predicted features, the tool can guide building energy 
managers and owners 
toward potential retrofit interventions.
